Simple memory trick

Instance method → uses self → one object

Class method → uses cls → whole class

Static method → uses nothing → just a utility

Real-life idea:

Instance method: “This student’s marks”

Class method: “Change school name for all students”

Static method: “Check if any marks are passing or not”
