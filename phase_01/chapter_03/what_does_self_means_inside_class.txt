What does self refer to inside a class's method?
**Short answer:**
`self` refers to the **current object (instance)** of the class.

---

### Slightly longer (interview-ready) explanation:

> Inside a class method, `self` represents the **specific object that is calling the method**. It allows the method to access and modify that object’s attributes and other methods.

---

### Example

```python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

    def greet(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name)
```

```python
p1 = Person("Alice")
p2 = Person("Bob")

p1.greet()
p2.greet()
```

* When `p1.greet()` is called → `self` refers to `p1`
* When `p2.greet()` is called → `self` refers to `p2`

So:

```python
self.name
```

means:

```python
p1.name   # or p2.name, depending on caller
```

---

### Important clarifications (very common confusion)

* `self` is **not a keyword** (you could name it something else, but don’t)
* Python **passes it automatically**
* It links **methods to object data**

---

### Interview one-liner (perfect to memorize)

> `self` refers to the instance of the class that is invoking the method, allowing access to its attributes and methods.

If you want, I can also explain:

* Why Python needs `self` but Java doesn’t
* What happens internally when a method is called
* How `self` differs from `cls`

Just tell me 👍
