# You are building a simple inventory system. Define a Python data structure to represent a single item. It must store:

# An item name (string)

# A quantity (integer)

# A price per unit (float)

# A list of supplier IDs (list of strings)

# Write the Python code to create one such item and assign it to a variable named widget. Use sample data of your choice.





widget = {
    "name": "Steel Widget",
    "quantity": 120,
    "price_per_unit": 49.99,
    "supplier_ids": ["SUP001", "SUP014", "SUP021"]
}

# this is an exmaple
