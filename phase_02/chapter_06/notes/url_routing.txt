🔁 The Full Routing Chain (Mental Model)

When a request comes in:

http://127.0.0.1:8000/about/


Django processes it in this order:

1️⃣ Project-level urls.py is checked first
2️⃣ If it finds include('pages.urls'), it delegates
3️⃣ Inside pages/urls.py, it checks patterns in order
4️⃣ If a pattern matches → the mapped view function runs

Order matters.
The first match wins.
