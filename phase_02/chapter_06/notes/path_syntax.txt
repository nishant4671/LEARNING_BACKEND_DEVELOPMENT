Understanding path()

The syntax:

path(route, view, name)


Let’s break it:

1️⃣ route

The URL pattern.

Examples:

'' → homepage

'about/'

'contact/'

Important:
Django expects trailing slash by default.

2️⃣ view

The function that runs if the route matches.

Example:

views.about


That function must:

Accept request

Return HttpResponse

3️⃣ name

Internal identifier.

Used later for:

Reverse URL lookup

Template linking

Avoiding hardcoded URLs

You don’t need it for functionality.
But professionals always use it.
