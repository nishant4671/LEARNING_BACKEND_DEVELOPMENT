1️⃣ manage.py — The Control Panel

Think of manage.py as a remote control for your Django project.

What it does:

Knows which settings file to load

Lets you run commands like:

runserver

migrate

createsuperuser

Key idea:

manage.py = “Do Django things for THIS project”

You rarely edit this file.
You use it.

2️⃣ settings.py — The Configuration Brain

This is where Django learns how your project should behave.

It contains:

Which apps exist (INSTALLED_APPS)

Which database to use (DATABASES)

Security settings

Middleware stack

Templates & static files config

Mental model:

settings.py = the DNA of your backend

Change settings → behavior changes everywhere.

3️⃣ urls.py — The Traffic Controller

This file answers one question:

“When a request comes to /something, which code should handle it?”

Example idea (not code yet):

/ → home page logic

/about → about page logic

/contact → contact page logic

Mental model:

urls.py = Google Maps for requests

No URL mapping → Django doesn’t know what to do → 404.

4️⃣ wsgi.py — The Deployment Bridge

This file is not for beginners to edit, but you must understand its role.

What it does:

Acts as a bridge between:

Django

A production server (Gunicorn, uWSGI, etc.)

Mental model:

wsgi.py = “How the outside world talks to Django”

In development, Django hides this from you.
In production, this becomes critical.
