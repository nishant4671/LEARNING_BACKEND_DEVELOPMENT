# Basic project creation
django-admin startproject myproject

# Or create project in current directory (recommended)
django-admin startproject myproject .
# The dot (.) means "current directory"





Create an isolated Python environment → install Django inside it → generate a Django project → bootstrap Django’s internal database → start a local web server

7️⃣ django-admin startproject myproject .

This is a core Django command.

Syntax breakdown

django-admin → Django’s project generator tool

startproject → create a new Django project

myproject → project name

. → current directory

Why the dot (.) matters

Without it:

chapter_06/
 └── myproject/
     └── manage.py


With it:

chapter_06/
 ├── manage.py
 └── myproject/


This layout is preferred for real projects.

🧠 Mental model

Outer folder = workspace

Inner folder = Django config package












🔟 python manage.py migrate

This is huge conceptually.

What manage.py is

A project-aware command runner

Wraps Django with:

settings

environment

configuration

What migrate does

Creates database tables for:

users

auth

sessions

admin

Important insight

👉 You did NOT write models yet
👉 Django still created tables

Why?
Because Django ships with built-in apps

🧠 This is Django’s “batteries included” philosophy in action



1️⃣1️⃣ python manage.py runserver
What happens internally

Django loads settings

URL router is prepared

Middleware stack is initialized

WSGI/ASGI interface boots

Local HTTP server starts

Output explained
Starting development server at http://127.0.0.1:8000/


127.0.0.1 = localhost

8000 = default dev port

The warning
WARNING: This is a development server


This server is:

single-threaded

insecure

slow

🧠 Production uses: Gunicorn, Uvicorn, etc.

1️⃣2️⃣ GET / HTTP/1.1" 200

This is pure gold.

It means:

Browser requested /

Django responded

HTTP status 200 = OK

The Django welcome page is proof that:

routing works

views work

templates work
