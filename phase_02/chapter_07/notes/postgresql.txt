🅰 Micro-Lesson — What Is PostgreSQL Really?

PostgreSQL is:

A powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS).

Break that down:

Relational → Data is stored in tables.

Tables → Made of rows and columns.

Rows → Individual records.

Columns → Defined structure (schema).

Example:

id	name	skill
1	Nishant	Python
2	Aarav	React

That is a table.

Now here is the crucial insight:

👉 Django does NOT store data.
👉 Django defines models.
👉 PostgreSQL stores the actual rows on disk.

Django ORM translates:

Student.objects.all()


Into:

SELECT * FROM student;


And sends that to PostgreSQL.

PostgreSQL executes it.
Returns the result.
Django converts it back into Python objects.

That translation layer = ORM (Object Relational Mapper).
