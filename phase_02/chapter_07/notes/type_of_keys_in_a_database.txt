Here are comprehensive notes about all the main **types of keys in a database**:

# DATABASE KEYS - Complete Notes

## 1. SUPER KEY
**Definition:** A super key is a set of one or more attributes (columns) that can uniquely identify a record (row) in a table.

**Characteristics:**
- May contain extra attributes that aren't strictly necessary for uniqueness
- Every table must have at least one super key
- Can be a single attribute or combination of attributes

**Example:**
```
Student Table: (Student_ID, Name, Email, Phone)
Super Keys could be:
- Student_ID (alone)
- Email (alone)
- Phone (alone)
- (Student_ID + Name)
- (Email + Phone)
- (Student_ID + Email + Name + Phone) - whole table
```

---

## 2. CANDIDATE KEY
**Definition:** A candidate key is a minimal super key – meaning it has no redundant attributes. It's a super key from which you cannot remove any attribute and still have uniqueness.

**Characteristics:**
- Minimal super key (no unnecessary attributes)
- Must uniquely identify each record
- Must be non-null (cannot contain NULL values)
- Must be unique across all records
- A table can have multiple candidate keys

**Example:**
```
From above Student Table:
Candidate Keys (minimal super keys):
- Student_ID (minimal)
- Email (minimal)
- Phone (minimal)

(Student_ID + Name) is NOT a candidate key because Name is redundant – Student_ID alone is enough
```

---

## 3. PRIMARY KEY
**Definition:** A primary key is a candidate key chosen by the database designer to uniquely identify each record in the table.

**Characteristics:**
- Must be unique for each row
- Cannot contain NULL values
- Only ONE primary key per table
- Automatically creates a clustered index (in most DBMS)
- Values should rarely (ideally never) change

**Rules:**
- Uniquely identifies each record
- Cannot be NULL
- Must be stable (not frequently updated)

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Student (
    Student_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(100),
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
-- Student_ID is the primary key
```

---

## 4. FOREIGN KEY
**Definition:** A foreign key is an attribute in one table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

**Characteristics:**
- Can contain NULL values
- Can have duplicate values
- A table can have multiple foreign keys
- References a primary key in another table
- Enforces referential integrity

**Referential Integrity Rules:**
- **RESTRICT:** Prevents deletion/update of referenced record
- **CASCADE:** Deletes/updates related records automatically
- **SET NULL:** Sets foreign key to NULL if referenced record is deleted
- **NO ACTION:** Similar to RESTRICT (syntax varies by DBMS)

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Orders (
    Order_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Order_Date DATE,
    Customer_ID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (Customer_ID) REFERENCES Customers(Customer_ID)
);
```

---

## 5. ALTERNATE KEY
**Definition:** Alternate keys are the candidate keys that were NOT chosen as the primary key.

**Characteristics:**
- Are candidate keys (minimal and unique)
- Could have been the primary key but weren't selected
- Also called secondary keys

**Example:**
```
Student Table:
Candidate Keys: Student_ID, Email, Phone
Primary Key chosen: Student_ID
Alternate Keys: Email, Phone
```

---

## 6. COMPOSITE KEY
**Definition:** A composite key is a key that consists of two or more attributes that together uniquely identify a record.

**Characteristics:**
- Made up of multiple columns
- Can be a primary key, candidate key, or foreign key
- Each column individually may not be unique, but the combination is unique

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Enrollment (
    Student_ID INT,
    Course_ID INT,
    Enrollment_Date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (Student_ID, Course_ID)  -- Composite Primary Key
);
```

---

## 7. COMPOUND KEY
**Definition:** Similar to composite key, but specifically refers to a key where each attribute is itself a foreign key.

**Example:**
```sql
-- If Student_ID references Student table
-- and Course_ID references Course table
-- Then (Student_ID, Course_ID) is a compound key
```

---

## 8. SURROGATE KEY
**Definition:** A surrogate key is an artificially created key (usually an auto-incrementing integer) that has no business meaning – it exists only for identification.

**Characteristics:**
- Has no business meaning (artificial)
- Usually system-generated (auto-increment, UUID, GUID)
- Never changes once assigned
- Hidden from users/application
- Ensures uniqueness regardless of business rules

**Advantages:**
- Stable (never changes)
- Performance (integers are fast to index)
- Not affected by business rule changes

**Disadvantages:**
- No business meaning (can hide data quality issues)
- Requires join to get meaningful information

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Employee (
    Employee_ID INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Surrogate key
    SSN VARCHAR(11) UNIQUE,                       -- Natural key
    Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

---

## 9. NATURAL KEY
**Definition:** A natural key is a key that exists naturally in the real world and has business meaning.

**Characteristics:**
- Has business meaning
- Exists in the real world
- Can be used as a primary key

**Examples:**
- SSN (Social Security Number)
- ISBN (for books)
- Email address
- Vehicle VIN
- Product SKU

**Disadvantages:**
- May change over time
- May not always be unique
- May be long/complex
- Business rules may change

---

## 10. SIMPLE KEY
**Definition:** A key that consists of only one attribute to uniquely identify records.

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Product (
    Product_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Simple key
    Product_Name VARCHAR(100)
);
```

## 11. CANDIDATE vs PRIMARY vs ALTERNATE Keys - Comparison Table

| Key Type | Uniqueness | NULL allowed | Number per table | Selected from |
|----------|------------|--------------|------------------|---------------|
| Candidate | Yes | No | Multiple | All minimal super keys |
| Primary | Yes | No | One | Candidate keys |
| Alternate | Yes | No | Multiple | Candidate keys not chosen as primary |

---

## 12. UNIQUE KEY
**Definition:** A constraint that ensures all values in a column or set of columns are unique.

**Difference from Primary Key:**
- Can have NULL values (usually only one NULL allowed)
- Can have multiple unique keys per table
- Creates a non-clustered index (usually)

**Example:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE User (
    User_ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    Email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```

## Summary Table

| Key Type | Purpose | Nullable | Unique | Quantity per table |
|----------|---------|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Super Key | Identify records uniquely | No | Yes | Multiple |
| Candidate Key | Minimal super key for identification | No | Yes | Multiple |
| Primary Key | Main identifier for table | No | Yes | One |
| Foreign Key | Link tables together | Yes | No | Multiple |
| Alternate Key | Candidate keys not chosen as PK | No | Yes | Multiple |
| Composite Key | Key with multiple columns | No | Yes | One |
| Surrogate Key | Artificial system-generated key | No | Yes | One |
| Natural Key | Real-world meaningful key | No | Yes | One |
| Unique Key | Enforce uniqueness | Yes (one null) | Yes | Multiple |

**Key Takeaway:** Understanding these keys is fundamental to:
- Database design (normalization)
- Query optimization (indexing)
- Data integrity (referential integrity)
- Relationship mapping (ER diagrams)
