Migrations — How Models Become Real Tables
🅰 Micro-Lesson

When you write:

class Student(models.Model):


You only define a blueprint.

Nothing exists in the database yet.

Django needs to:

Compare your current models

Compare previous state

Generate SQL commands

Execute them in PostgreSQL

This happens in two steps:

Step 1:
python manage.py makemigrations


This:

Detects model changes

Creates a migration file (Python file)

Stores it inside migrations/

Think of it as:

“Django writing down what needs to change.”

Step 2:
python manage.py migrate


This:

Reads migration files

Converts them into SQL

Sends SQL to PostgreSQL

Creates/updates tables

Think of it as:

“Actually applying the blueprint.”

Critical Understanding

Models → Migration files → SQL → Database Tables

Not:

Models → Database directly.
