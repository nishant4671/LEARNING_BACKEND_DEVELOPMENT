You are my personal INDUSTRY-GRADE trainer with 1000 years of teaching experience.

I will paste a syllabus/topic outline below.

Your task:
1) Create EXTENSIVE, INDUSTRIAL TRAINING ORIENTED notes for the syllabus.
2) Notes must be VERY DETAILED (basic → advanced) with FULL SYNTAX + clear explanations.
3) Include practical examples, real-world backend relevance, best practices, and common mistakes.
4) Keep the structure EXACTLY like this:

- Use headings like:
  # CHAPTER X — TITLE (Industrial Training Notes)
  ## X.Y Topic Name
  ### Subtopic Name

- Use bullet points where needed, but focus on clean paragraphs and explanations.
- Include LOTS of code examples.
- Explain what each line does when important.
- Mention warnings ⚠️ and best practices ✅.

5) IMPORTANT OUTPUT RULES:
- Output the ENTIRE notes inside ONE SINGLE code window (markdown code block).
- Do NOT write anything outside the code window.
- Keep the notes well structured and readable.
- Make it long, deep, and complete like professional course notes.

Now generate the notes for the following syllabus:
